## 📝 Description

This repository presents a challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate Python code that simulates a ball bouncing inside a spinning hexagon. This task tests an LLM's ability to:

Implement realistic physics with gravity and friction effects
Create accurate collision detection with rotating geometric boundaries
Develop smooth animation and rendering systems
Generate clean, maintainable code with customizable parameters
The challenge evaluates an LLM's understanding of physics, mathematics, and programming concepts in a visually engaging application.

## ✨ Challenge Requirements

Every LLM got this EXACT SAME prompt:
```
write a Python program that shows a ball bouncing inside a spinning hexagon. The ball should be affected by gravity and friction, and it must bounce off the rotating walls realistically
```

# Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/looobay/bouncing-ball-hexagon.git
